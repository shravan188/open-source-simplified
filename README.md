# Open Source Simplified

The goal of this repository is to reduce the entry barrier for new contributors to contribute to open source. This is achieved by creating specialized roadmaps which are highly tailored to specific open source projects, so that the contributor becomes ready to start contributing the moment they complete the full roadmap.
